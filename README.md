# Todolist
School server programming course project. 

In this application user can make an private account in a web service and use it to login. When logged in users can create own tasklists and add different customizable tasks (with tracked deadlines) to their own lists and track them. Tasks have three different states: "ToDo", "in progress" and "Done". Tasks can be moved between each state, edited and removed at users will.

Project was made using Java SpringBoot and UI was made using Thymeleaf (html).

Application is running on: https://tasklisterapp.herokuapp.com/ (might take a minute to wake up from hibernation).
